    <h1>User Agent Redirect Request</h1>
    <p>Dear Customer,</p>
    <p>Thank you for contacting us with your request to redirect visitors depending on their user agent. Although, Cloudflare's standard Page Rules do not support user agent-based redirections, you can implement this feature with Cloudflare Workers.</p>
    <p>Thought Process:</p>
    <p>Given the limitations of Page Rules and knowing that Workers are a versatile and powerful, they may come across as a solution that allows to run JavaScript at the edge, inspecting incoming requests and modifying replies or redirection based on factors such as the user agent.</p>
    <p>Tools Used:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cloudflare Workers: Allows to write and deploy JavaScript that executes directly on Cloudflare's edge nodes.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you need help or have other questions, please donâ€™t hesitate to ask us.</p>
